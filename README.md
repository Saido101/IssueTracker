# Introduction
This is a Simple Issue Tracker System in PHP. It is a mini-project that manages the issues for some processes, forms, products, or anything that needs to be fixed with another department of the company. It is a sort of issue ticketing system that provides an automated platform for the company's employees to raise the problem or issue they encounter for a certain process/turn over a project or anything that needs to be fixed to the department who are eligible/capable to fix it.

# About the Simple Issue Tracker System
This Mini-Project has 2 types of users which are the admin and employees. The admin is in charge of managing or populating the list of the company's departments and employees. He/She also can overwrite the action made by the employees. The employee user can create or post an issue for a specific department and he/she and the staff in the selected department can communicate with each other by leaving some comments about the posted issue. The project is very simple yet might be useful especially for those who are new to PHP Language. It has a simple user interface using bootstrap and user-friendly functionalities.
